# Education Data Analysis

## Why is the `bar_chart_high_school` ineffective, and what do you suggest to improve the plot?
The plot is only a snapshot of a single year, making it hard to find any sort of correlation
between the sexes. I think it would be best to place a timeframe for x, and then use the
sexes as a hue to give viewers a better understanding as to how education for sexes has changed
and why 2009 looks that way. 


## How and why did you choose the plot for `plot_hispanic_min_degree`?
I chose to use a line plot because there is only one y value, percentage, for every
x value, year, meaning that you can linearly show the change as time went on. The plot
also needed to show 3 variables: time, percentage, and type of degree. This meant that
a hue/marker would've been needed to show the difference between high school and
bachelor's. 



## Describe a possible bias present in this dataset and why it might have occurred.
The dataset doesn't account for income and environment, which arguably are bigger factors
for education inequality than race. A big reason why Asians can be 90%+ is becaue of how
education is viewed as vital for a better life and working isn't as much a priority until
the kids finish their education. This helps each following generation to have higher income
and not have to be burdened with having to work in high school/right afterwards to pay
for rent instead of a higher education.


## Describe an application, analysis, or decision motivated by this dataset with the intended goal of improving educational equity but that ultimately exacerbates social injustice.
A study probably saw that there was an overrepresentation of certain races going to college,
leading to a study of the percentages of all the races and the education levels achieved.
I feel like this is not a good metric because the chances of someone from the cornfields of
Nebraska with a low income is way less likely to get a higher education than some random kid
of the same race in a city like Seattle or even smaller ones like Marysville.
