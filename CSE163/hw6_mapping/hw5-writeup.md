# Food Desert Analysis

## What is one way that government officials could use `plot_food_access_by_county` or 
## `plot_low_access_tracts` to shape public policy on how to improve food access?
The government can focus on similarities that tracts with low access have so
that they can create policies to reduce low food access. Income is only one
factor, but now that they know which place is affected, other hypotheses can
be made and tested to better understand the problem.


## What is a limitation or concern with using the plots in this way?
There is missing data, meaning that the plot is actually incomplete and data
for missing counties are not represented at all and could feel left out.
Another limitation is more of a concern for rural areas but there is just
large swaths of land that no one wants to build upon because it's the middle
of nowhere and you can't make much money out there. Policies to improve food
access would require more people/companies to move out to the countryside,
which is a tall task.
